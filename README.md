# Movie Dialogue Scrapper

A console application written in golang to scrape movies and its dialogue.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[go](https://golang.org/) installed and ready to go. I refered to this [link](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install go.

[goQuery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery), a Jquery for go which makes scrapping way easy. [This](https://godoc.org/github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery) documentation is very thorough and is easy to grasp.
